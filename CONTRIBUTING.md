# Contributing to Create InstantSearch App

Thank you for wanting to get involved in Create InstantSearch App! The goal of the package is to enable users to create InstantSearch applications quickly.

## Core concepts

The `create-instantsearch-app` CLI is based on the module `createInstantSearchApp(path, options?, tasks?)`.

### Folder structure

```
▸ src
  ▸ api               The source code of the module `createInstantSearchApp()`
  ▸ cli               The source code of the CLI `create-instantsearch-app`
  ▸ tasks             The tasks of the app generation lifecycle
  ▸ templates         The official templates supported
  ▸ utils             The utility functions for the package
▸ scripts             The end-to-end tests and release scripts

```

### Adding a template

When [adding a template](README.md#templates), you will need to run end-to-end tests (`yarn run test:e2e:templates`) to update all the [snapshots](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html). These snapshots are meant to avoid regressions that can potentially happen when we unintentionally update a behavior in the source code.

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 8
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) (to run end-to-end tests for the [InstantSearch iOS template](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app/tree/master/src/templates/InstantSearch%20iOS))

## Conventions

### Commits

This project follows the [conventional changelog](https://conventionalcommits.org/) approach. This means that all commit messages should be formatted using the following scheme:

```
type(scope): description
```

These commits are then used to generate the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Workflow

### Filing issues

Creating issues, either for reporting a bug or asking for a new feature is always great. [When doing so](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app/issues/new/choose), you'll get asked what kind of issue you want to create. Each of these templates will help you create an effective report.

### Contributing to the code

Code contributions are always welcome, although you should make sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app/issues/new/choose) to notice us what you plan to do.

You will need to follow these steps:

- [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
- Clone your fork
- Install the dependencies: `yarn`
- [Create a new branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/#creating-a-branch)
  - `fix/issue-number` for a fix
  - `feat/name-of-the-feature` for a feature
  - `docs/what-you-changed` for documentation
- Make your changes
- Run tests:
  - `yarn lint`
  - `yarn test`
  - `yarn test:e2e`
- [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

We will then review your pull request!

### Releasing

We rely on [release-it](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) to release new versions of Create InstantSearch App.

###### Release flow

1.  Bump the project version in [`package.json`](package.json) based on [the commits](#conventions)
1.  Generate the changelog
1.  Commit the new release
1.  Create the new release tag
1.  Push to GitHub
1.  Create the new release on GitHub
1.  Publish to npm
1.  Push the generated templates to the [`templates`](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app/tree/templates) branch (usable on CodeSandbox)

###### Release steps

To release a new version of the package, you need to:

1.  [Generate a new GitHub token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the scope `repo` (necessary for creating GitHub releases)
1.  Store this token in an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) called `GITHUB_TOKEN_CISA`
1.  Make sure you're on the `master` branch
1.  Run commands (_do not_ use `yarn` for releasing):
    - `npm run release:beta` for a new beta version
    - `npm run release` for a new stable version
1.  Follow the command-line instructions

### Updating templates on CodeSandbox

If the InstantSearch versions are outdated in the CodeSandbox templates, make sure you're on the `master` branch and that your working directory is clean, then run:

```
npm run release-templates
```

It will regenerate the templates, fetch the latest InstantSearch versions from the npm index and push to the [`templates`](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app/tree/templates) branch (usable on CodeSandbox).
